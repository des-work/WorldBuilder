WorldBuilder AI is a desktop application designed for writers, game developers, dungeon masters, and any creator who needs to manage complex fictional worlds. It provides a structured, hierarchical way to organize your ideas, from the grandest universe down to the individual chapters of a story, all while offering intelligent assistance to spark your creativity.

## What is WorldBuilder AI?

WorldBuilder AI transforms the daunting task of world-building from a static, note-taking exercise into a dynamic, interactive conversation. It's a desktop application for writers, game developers, and dungeon masters who want to go deeper than a wiki. WorldBuilder AI is your co-creator, helping you not only to document your world but to truly *understand* it.

At its heart, it combines a powerful organizational framework with a **100% local, private, and context-aware AI** that brings your universe to life.

## Why WorldBuilder AI?

*   **From World Bible to Living World:** Don't just write *about* your characters‚Äî**talk to them**. Genisis AI's core feature is its ability to let you have real, in-character conversations. The AI embodies your character's persona, drawing from their bio, their world's lore, and even events from chapters they've appeared in.

*   **Your Private AI Co-Creator:** All AI processing happens on your machine via Ollama. Your prompts, your world's data, and your creative sparks **never leave your computer**. You can use any model you've downloaded, ensuring complete privacy and ownership.

*   **A Structure That Sparks Creativity:** The hierarchical `TreeView` provides the perfect balance of organization and discovery. See the grand sweep of your universe, then drill down into the details of a single chapter or character with a click.

*   **Built for the Modern Creator:** A clean, intuitive interface with modern UX considerations like "dirty" state tracking and "Saved!" notifications means you spend less time fighting the tool and more time creating.

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

*   **.NET 8 SDK** (or newer)
*   **Visual Studio 2022** with the ".NET desktop development" workload installed.
*   **Ollama:** To use the AI features, you must have Ollama installed and running on your machine with at least one model downloaded (e.g., `ollama run llama3`).
