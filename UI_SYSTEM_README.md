## Usage

### Basic Theme Switching

```csharp
// Get theme service
var themeService = new ThemeService();
await themeService.InitializeAsync();

// Switch theme
await themeService.SwitchThemeAsync("fantasy", animate: true);

// Save preference
await themeService.SaveThemePreferenceAsync("fantasy");
```

### Custom Theme Creation

```csharp
public class CustomThemeProvider : IThemeProvider
{
    public string ThemeId => "custom";
    public string ThemeName => "Custom Theme";
    public string Description => "My custom theme";

    public ColorPalette PrimaryColors { get; } = new()
    {
        Primary = Colors.Blue,
        Secondary = Colors.Gray,
        Accent = Colors.Orange,
        // ... other colors
    };

    // ... implement other properties
}
```

### Timeline Navigation

```csharp
// Add custom navigation node
var customNode = new NavigationNode("custom", "ðŸ”§", "Custom", "Custom Tool");
TimelineNavigation.NavigationNodes.Add(customNode);

// Handle node clicks
TimelineNavigation.NodeClicked += (sender, e) =>
{
    if (e.Node.Id == "custom")
    {
        // Handle custom navigation
    }
};
```

## Performance Considerations

### Animation Performance
- Uses WPF's built-in animation system for smooth performance
- GPU-accelerated animations where possible
- Efficient particle systems with cleanup
- Theme transitions use interpolation for smooth color changes

### Memory Management
- Proper cleanup of animation resources
- Efficient particle management
- Theme resource cleanup on switching
- Event unsubscription to prevent memory leaks

### Resource Optimization
- Lazy loading of theme resources
- Efficient color interpolation
- Optimized animation timing
- Minimal resource duplication

## Extensibility

### Adding New Themes
1. Create a new class implementing `IThemeProvider`
2. Define color palettes, typography, and animation settings
3. Register the theme with `ThemeManager`
4. Update theme selector UI if needed

### Adding New Navigation Nodes
1. Create a new `NavigationNode` instance
2. Add it to the `TimelineNavigationControl`
3. Handle the `NodeClicked` event
4. Implement navigation logic

### Customizing Animations
1. Modify animation settings in theme providers
2. Adjust timing and easing functions
3. Create custom animation storyboards
4. Integrate with theme system

## Best Practices

### Theme Development
- Use consistent color palettes across themes
- Ensure good contrast for accessibility
- Test animations on different hardware
- Provide fallback values for missing resources

### Performance
- Use efficient animation techniques
- Clean up resources properly
- Avoid memory leaks in event handlers
- Test on lower-end hardware

### User Experience
- Provide smooth transitions
- Give visual feedback for interactions
- Maintain consistent behavior across themes
- Test with different screen sizes

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
- **Custom Theme Editor**: Visual theme creation tool
- **Animation Presets**: Predefined animation sets
- **Accessibility Options**: High contrast and reduced motion
- **Performance Profiles**: Optimized settings for different hardware

### Integration Opportunities
- **AI-Generated Themes**: Themes based on universe content
- **Dynamic Theming**: Themes that change based on context
- **Collaborative Themes**: Shared theme libraries
- **Export/Import**: Theme sharing between users

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Theme not applying**: Check theme registration and resource loading
2. **Animation performance**: Reduce particle count or disable animations
3. **Memory leaks**: Ensure proper cleanup of event handlers
4. **Color conflicts**: Check for resource key conflicts

### Debug Tips
- Use WPF Inspector for visual debugging
- Check application logs for theme-related errors
- Test with different themes to isolate issues
- Verify resource dictionary loading

## Conclusion

The World Builder UI system provides a solid foundation for creating immersive, themeable user interfaces. Its modular architecture makes it easy to extend and customize, while the comprehensive theme system allows for rich visual experiences that match the creative nature of world-building applications.

The system is designed to grow with the application, supporting new features and themes as they are developed. The focus on performance and user experience ensures that the UI remains responsive and engaging even as the application becomes more complex.
